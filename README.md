## ‚öôÔ∏èüë®‚Äçüíª Mechatronics Engineer Student | Researcher in Embedded Systems, AI & Robotics

As a Mechatronics Engineer Student at Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia my focus is on embedded systems, artificial intelligence and robotics. My work current is on merging cutting-edge technologies like deep learning and IoT with hands-on engineering to solve complex challenges‚Äîwhether optimizing robotic algorithms or designing firmware telemetry systems. For me, engineering is about turning theoretical concepts into tangible innovations that push boundaries.

Currently pursuing my B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering, I‚Äôve honed my skills through research roles like developing embedded firmware in C/C++ for ESP32/STM32 platforms at Propulsion and Aeroespace Technology Team (EPTA) and advancing AI-driven loco-manipulation strategies for Boston Dynamics‚Äô Spot robot at Mobile Robotics Research (LabRoM, CRoB ‚Äì University of S√£o Paulo.  I‚Äôm passionate about embedded IoT systems, artificial inteligence techniques (ML & DL) for robotics, and crafting sustainable solutions through clean, efficient code. Every project is a step toward bridging the gap between hardware and intelligent software, and I thrive on the challenge of making robots "think" and act autonomously.

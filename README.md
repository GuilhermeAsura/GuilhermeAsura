## ‚öôÔ∏èüë®‚Äçüíª Mechatronics Engineer Student | Embedded Systems, AI & Robotics

As a Mechatronics Engineer Student at Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia my focus is on embedded systems, artificial intelligence and robotics. My work current is on merging cutting-edge technologies like deep learning and IoT with hands-on engineering to solve complex challenges‚Äîwhether optimizing robotic algorithms or designing firmware telemetry systems. For me, engineering is about turning theoretical concepts into tangible innovations that push boundaries.

Currently pursuing my B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering, I constantly hone my skills in the projects and research I participate in, such as developing embedded firmware in C/C++ for ESP32/STM32 platforms at a Rockemodelism Team and developing AI-driven Loco-Manipulation strategies with Boston Dynamics‚Äô Spot robot at Laboratory of Robotics (LabRoM,CRob ‚Äì University of S√£o Paulo).  I‚Äôm passionate about Embedded Systems, Artificial Inteligence techniques for robotics, and crafting sustainable solutions through code. Every project is a step toward bridging the gap between hardware and intelligent software, and I thrive on the challenge of making machines "think" and act autonomously.
